#Secret Santa
"Secret Santa" naturally reduces into a graph problem - each participant becomes a node and each gift exchange results in a directed edge. Each participant has exactly one incoming and outgoing edge. The simple (boring) set of pairings is a hamiltonian cycle (a circle of size n), but we can make something more fun! Instead, I made the pairing generation truly random; the only "outlawed" relationship is a self-loop (no one wants to give themselves a present). This way we can have as many n/2 cycles ([n-1]/2 if n is odd) within our produced graph. 

##Setup
Setting up JavaMail was the most complex portion of this project. Hopefully, this instruction set will make the api a little more understandable. This [cumulative tutorial] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/send-email-using-java-program/), [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2965251/javamail-with-gmail-535-5-7-1-username-and-password-not-accepted/2965433) and [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26548059/sending-email-with-ssl-using-javax-mail) Stack Overflow articles were helpful.
- First, download the [JavaMail API](https://javaee.github.io/javamail/) (it's labelled javax.mail.jar on the download page) and name it `mail.jar`. 
- Next, download the [Java Activation Framework] (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-135046.html#download) and name it `activation.jar`.
- Make sure you add the above two jars to your build path!
- I used my personal gmail account to send out the emails in this project. This code only works with gmail accounts. (Otherwise you need to change the smtp settings). Before using a specific gmail account, you need to enable two step verification on your gmail account. Google will block remote login from a random java script unless you perform the following step.
- Create an "application password" that enables your project to bypass two-step verification. Follow [this tutorial] (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) to generate one. After doing so, replace the `from` variable with your own email and the `appPassword` with the password you just created. You won't need to use this new password to login anywhere else. 
- Your input.csv file should have *names* in the first column, *emails* in the second column and *gift suggestions* in the third column. You won't need any headers.
